QBOM: Quantum Bill of Materials

Invisible provenance capture for quantum computing experiments.
One import. Complete reproducibility.

Usage:
    import qbom  # That's it. Everything is now captured.

    # Your quantum code works exactly as before
    from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, transpile
    qc = QuantumCircuit(2)
    qc.h(0)
    qc.cx(0, 1)
    # ...

    # Access your trace
    trace = qbom.current()
    trace.export("experiment.qbom.json")
